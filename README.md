# Kafka Benchmark

A very simple benchmark script for Kafka.

# Usage

1. Insert a sample message into `message.txt`.
2. Set up your Kafka connection at `config.py`.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the benchmark with `python benchmark.py`

This will produce as many messages as possible until it  
reaches the configured number of messages.
